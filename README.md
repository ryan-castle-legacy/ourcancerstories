## OurCancerStories

**I was creating a blog platform** for myself and cancer patients to share their stories, thoughts, experience, etc.

I owned the website address (OurCancerStories.com), and I was going to launch that this year too!

—

All of the code I have written is very very basic, but if anyone wants to know what code is, have fun!

(Feel free to send an email about the code before I pass - hello@ryancastle.co.uk)

—

If you ever think that you would use this domain (for the stuff I’d have made - blogs, charities, info, etc), please get in touch - hello@ryancastle.co.uk

—

Any funding will be used to keep my website up and running so that others can be inspired by my legacy, stories, and the blog.
